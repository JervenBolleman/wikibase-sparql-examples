Regio I degli scavi archeologici di Pompei location), but many buildings are just \"houses\" or \"shops\" with no further specification and obviously no wikilinks. Such elements though do have references to external sites (although not to the official site) and are included in the WLM lists. Can they be inserted as items in Wikidata along with their WLM IDs and statements about their location (e.g. hereI am working on the migration of Italian WLM lists to Wikidata and I have a question about notability. We have detailed lists of all the buildings in Pompeii (e.g. 22:33, 15 September 2016 (UTC) Jura--- Entries in monuments lists are fine.  09:11, 21 September 2016 (UTC)) talk (NvitucciNot all of them have links to images in Commons, so probably (1) does not apply (yet).

By the way, what do you mean with \"there are two entries\"?  05:51, 23 September 2016 (UTC) Jura--- Not sure if it's a good idea to add some random computed text as English label. I think the Italian one should do. There do seem to be two entries for \"Caupona di Epagatus\".  20:57, 22 September 2016 (UTC)) talk (NvitucciIf you mean that \"I.1.1\" is computable then yes, it is: I did it for the Italian label in the same way. I'm not aware of an item for the catalogue you have linked; a few days ago I searched for references of such numbering system in an official catalogue, but I haven't found any. Since the lists are basically built using this website (which is the \"external site\" I mentioned in the first post) as a source, if it's deemed \"good enough\" the catalogue item can be created and used.  20:33, 22 September 2016 (UTC) Andy's edits; Talk to Andy); Pigsonthewing (Andy Mabbett - do we have an item for that? [7] qualifier, for the catalogue described at (P972)catalog , which needs a better (P528)catalog code . That should be computable. It can be changed to an alias when a better label is available.

Anyway I think that there is a description problem for Q26971668: \"Italian cultural property\" would be probably better as a label since it is meant as an item of the cultural heritage, not necessarily a place. (P2186)Wiki Loves Monuments ID  is recommended when (P1435)heritage designation I see what you mean and actually I agree. The presence of  16:23, 22 September 2016 (UTC) Jura--- If it's only a component of an \"Italian national heritage site\", I wouldn't add Q26971668 in P1435 (or p31). \"Part of\" seems to be the way to link it to the site, but maybe a more accurate statement about its status can be made.  21:13, 24 September 2016 (UTC)) talk (Izno: Indeed. --TomT0m@ 10:55, 24 September 2016 (UTC) pagetalk  / TomT0m author . just to clarify, no opposition to that This is acknowledging that we assimilate any heritage status item to the class of all monuments/sites that have this status.

We will get soon code to print the content of items as lists into Wikipedia. Maybe it could be done this way. PS: We already have de:Liste_von_Gebäuden_in_PompejiMaybe it is enough if the number is in the label \"Pompeii VI.15.1\" or in the alias name \"I.1.1\". Are you sure it would not be better to say \"Pompeii I.1.1\" in the alias name? The reason is that I can search for \"Pompeii I.1.1\" and it does not matter if it is written in the label or in the alias name, I will find that item. You can check that with searching for \"Casa dei Vettii\" and \"Pompeii VI.15.1\". You should be able to find the item with both ways.
