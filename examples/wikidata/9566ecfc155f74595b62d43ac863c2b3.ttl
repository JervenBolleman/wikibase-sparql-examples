  rdfs:comment "Modeling the ratings and reviews of criticsIs anyone aware of a precedent for general modeling of quality ratings and reviews by critics? Expert organizations and commentators routinely rate and review media, places, products, and organizations. Here are some examples:  - media suitability ratings(Q5165090)content rating   - rates environmental factors, like public access to parks(Q637866)book review   - is an academic field which presents commentary on all sorts of media(Q58854)literary criticism   - rates consumer products like toasters, dishwashers, and sunscreen(Q1329436)consumer organization   - rates new books(Q637866)book review Every big budget, book, music collection, video game, and movie gets critic ratings from lots of publications. In academia all sorts of individuals, organizations, and journals rate and review everything that is the subject of human discourse. Citizens, corporate entities, and government rate and review each other continually. What discussion already exists about bringing this into Wikidata? I am especially interested in brief ratings, either numbers on a scale, a grade, single words, or a generalization like pass/fail. Let's put complex ratings and reviews, like essays, aside for now. Possible paths forwardSomething else? Perhaps we match this with identifiers, as many ratings are from data collections?Have some general property which we adapt with qualifiers  Seems unlikely as there are endless rating systems and the majority are small datasets of <100 ratingsHave Wikidata properties for every sort of rating  14:14, 29 August 2019 (UTC) (talk) Blue Rasberry Thanks.
