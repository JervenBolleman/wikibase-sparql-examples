# also viewable as table
# querying qualifiers
### Note: In comparison with the parent section \"Graph of shifus and parents among xiangsheng performers: the use of UNION\",
### this query, by using FILTER NOT EXISTS, gets shifu-disciple relations only in the \"legitimate\" family tree of xiangsheng performers,
### so that generations are not messed up (by He Yunwei).

               ### so that this query only gets those in the \"legitimate\" family tree of xiangsheng performers.
               ### 2. FILTER (\"values of ?x3's qualifier P1534\" != Q873222) is inapplicable here
               ### because it removes not only those shifu-disciple relations that ended up in expulsion,
