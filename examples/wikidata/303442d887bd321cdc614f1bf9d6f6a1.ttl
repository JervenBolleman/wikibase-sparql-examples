I would expect national team items to be considerably different from club-level teams, thus a distinction in P31 sounds reasonable.

No matter whether you look at open age men's/women's, or any gender’s age group association football, there is only one set of rules, and a distinct set of required skills for success in this type of sport. Nevertheless there is a need to define competition classes in almost all types of sports due to intrinsic physiological differences between certain groups of humans (e.g. women vs. men, young people vs. old people, heavy people vs. light people, etc). This way, one enables participation of sportspersons that would otherwise not have any chance to compete at the highest level. The competition class in fact defines who is eligible to participate in a given competition, mostly based on physical properties such as age, gender, and body mass (not in association football); in some types of sports, equipment also plays a role, which is not the case for association football. If we now look at national teams, we realize that one does not simply become eligible to play in such a team by a given physical constitution. You need to qualify yourself by superior performances. \"National teams\" are therefore not special competition classes, and P2094 can’t be used.(Q2736)association football A key aspect here is that all kinds of teams/players/clubs/competitions/etc. are about the same type of sport, which is"@en;
