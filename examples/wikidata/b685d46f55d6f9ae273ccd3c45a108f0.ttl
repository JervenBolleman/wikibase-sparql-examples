  rdfs:comment ". Double-check that it says \"OSM Planet\" and not \"Wikidata\" in the upper left corner. Now click on \"examples\" and select the first one \"All buildings in St√ºhlinger\". You can click on \"Map view\" to get map view as well. Have fun and play around with it. If you need something more advanced such as federating against Wikidata, that should be possible, but at least for now this should get you started. You can have a look at which data is contained in the relation you mentioned using the following query, since QLever doesn't support DESCRIBE queries yet.https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/osm-planetThe same people that built the tool I mentioned also put up the resulting triplestore so that you can query for geometry there. This opens up some nice opportunities. Go to the QLever public demo at"@en;
