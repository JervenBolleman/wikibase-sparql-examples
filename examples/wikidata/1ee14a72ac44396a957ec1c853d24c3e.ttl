  rdfs:comment "When we run this query now (2020-11) we get ca. 5K hits. In 2020-09 we ran \"the same query\" and got 13K hits. We have the Wikidata SPARQL-XML output from 2020-09 which indeed has 13K hits. It's a superset of our current 5K hits. But it doesn't record what query we submitted! Some of us are sure we submitted the same query. Others think that the query was a broader one. So one way to resolve it would have been to re-run it with 2020-09 version.  09:53, 26 November 2020 (UTC)) talk (PetermrThe wider issue is whether it's possible to record the query in the SPARQL-XML. I think that would be a useful feature, but it's probably non-trivial.09:57, 26 November 2020 (UTC)) talk (SteakYou could just reverse engineer from the results list, what the query must have been. 09:59, 26 November 2020 (UTC) JuraSome bot removed plenty of P31 statements the other day.

The nice thing about the field is that it doesn't really overlap with things that interest me. ---  13:43, 26 November 2020 (UTC) Jura. --- Property_talk:P699Sounds sensible. Maybe worth summarizing on  13:27, 26 November 2020 (UTC)) talk (Andrawaag, we minted both a P31 and P279 at the time. However, semantically that was incorrect and not in line with how it is expressed in the source. There everything is connecting as subclasses. This task is long overdue, since the WDQS already exists for a while, but since we are updating identifier mappings we are also removing those redundant (and partly incorrect) P31 claims. So the number returning on the query above might even decrease more in the near future. The suggestion to use wdt:P31/wdt:P279* should return all diseases. --(Q5282129)Disease Ontology . Regarding the P31. Before WDQS existed there was WDQ which made traversing a tree rather complex. To be able to query for all disease items sourced from the (Q5282129)Disease Ontology  to express exact similarity. Since XREFs mappings were no longer accurate we had to remove them from Wikidata and replace them with those that were expressed using skos:exactMatch. So indeed identifiers were removed (but only those with a reference to the skos:exactMatch started using (Q5282129)Disease Ontology  only used Xrefs to express mappings to external knowledge bases and identifier. However this turned out to be problematic, since the semantics of Xrefs are not wel defined. Not every XREF mapping is an exact match. Recently, (Q5282129)Disease Ontology . Until recently, (Q27468140)Mondo Disease Ontology  and (Q5282129)Disease Ontology : There are two things hapening here.
