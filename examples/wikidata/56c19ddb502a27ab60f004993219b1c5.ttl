# find Jia Baoyu's extended blood relatives, i.e., those whose descendant's ancestor's descendant's... share a common ancestor with Jia Baoyu
### Note: In comparison with the previous query \"Graph of gene pool (extended blood relatives) by only parent/child relation (no siblings): Jia Baoyu\",
### this query only shows parent (father/mother), not including child, on graph edge, so that the arrows are single headed, not double headed,
### as those in the parent section \"Graph of extended parent/child countries: the Qin dynasty\" (actually having an extended-blood-relatives structure),
### and therefore the graph can present correct generations in a hierarchical layout.
