  rdfs:comment "Tilfælde og klasser . But there are in fact two kinds of relations there: is occupation. But sometimes (in fact, frequently), you also need to talk about what something has father, has child, hasEarlier, I said that most Wikidata properties are “has” relations:    a work of art.isA film   a film.is Gone with the Wind   is one particular film.

If \"is a kind of\" works (e.g. A film \"is a kind of\" work of art), it indicates that you are talking about a subclass, a specialization of a broader class and you should use   So what does this mean for us when we’re writing SPARQL queries?
