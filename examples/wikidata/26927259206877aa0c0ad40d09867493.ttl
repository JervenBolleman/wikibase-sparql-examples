  rdfs:comment "Venezuelan people 19:01, 4 January 2018 (UTC)) talk (Jamez42Hi! I'm still learning how to use the Query Service and my computer is currently very slow. I'm working on creating lists in the Spanish Wikipedia about years in Venezuela, so I wanted to search Venezuelan persons that were either born or have died in the following years: 1833, 1834, 1838, 1839, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847, 1849, 1850, 1851, 1852, 1853, 1855, 1856, 1857, 1865, 1866, 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1874, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1880 and 1882.

(Q330882)Gregor MacGregor : The FILTER on years is really elegant - I didn't know you could do that! Here's an adapted query, which also finds anyone who was born or died in Venezuela in those years, even if they're not listed as Venezuelan. There's about 24 extra names - I think some are missing the country and others like Jamez42, Jura1@"@en;
