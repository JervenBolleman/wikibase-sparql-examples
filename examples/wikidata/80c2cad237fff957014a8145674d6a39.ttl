We could set different values with qualifier \"applies to part\" (in this case \"hieroglyphic text: partial\", \"demotic text: complete\", \"greek text: partial\" (I haven't counted the words but as far as I remember from my 2003 school project, the Greek text is largely intact.). - Another way would be to label the whole text as \"state of transmission: partial\" as substantial parts of the hieroglyphic and some parts of the Greek text are missing. But this point is certainly up for debate and I will gladly explore it further with you and others.  : For works that have surviving translations in another language, I suggest we do as the Clavis Historicorum does and consider any translation a work in its own right and create items for them as well.

If we're talking about one translation's survival status, we can put it on the translation item, fine. But either a work or a version could be considered lost or extant. work editions are known to exist, the no If no known copies of a book, as a work, are known to survive. for the works. We can blur the line between work and version a little bit, that's fine. Most people care about the work anyway. No one ever asks the question, \"hmmm, is this specific reprint of an edition from 1923 a lost reprint?\" No... It's much more meaningful to someone if are use the work rather than the version, and that even on Wikisource, versions pages primarily, let's have the works get some respect too. It seems like so many people keep forgetting that basically every site, including Wikipedia and Wikiquote for two examples, Not everything has to go to the versionsSigh... Again with the unnecessary prioritization of versions over works. Just because of the translation situation. FYI, translations can also have versions of those translations, such as newer editions of the same translation... And editions can have versions, such as reprints of the same \"second edition\".

The property proposed here is meant to apply to works as immaterial concepts instead (especially from the pre-print era). (P5816)state of conservation : Thanks for your comment! I realise now that I have indeed not clarified what I meant by \"works\". I do indeed refer to works as immaterial concepts and not of their material witnesses, i.e. the papyrus scrap, ostracon, manuscript or palm leaf transmitting the work. Those are objects in their own right and they should be classified according to their nature, perhaps using Jahl de Vautban@ ]reply[19:16, 7 August 2023 (UTC)) talk (Jahl de Vautban as a work and not an edition. --(Q1220978)Ilias Latina . For existing translations of lost works however, my point of view would join the one of Jonathan, not least because the translation might well be know only by copies of copies and we can't in fact judge if the translation is acurate or faithful. Moreover, we are speaking of translations that have themselve a complex history of transmission. I have the feeling that those weren't really taken into account when devising the Bibframe model we are using here; likewise, most if not all libraries catalog (P5816)state of conservation :, at least for the Rosetta Stone: the three texts are three versions of the same edict by Ptolemy V, and thus should only be considered with EncycloPetey, but I do think there should be one. For me however, the fundamental distinction shouldn't be between buildings and works, but between material and immaterial concepts. To take an example, a given papyrus or manuscript might be only preserved as a fragment, and if its the only testimonium of a work then the work itself is only transmitted as a fragment. But this fragmentary papyrus might well be one among an hundred and therefore the whole work is entirely transmitted. This distinction might help solve the points mentionned by @(P5816)state of conservation  I'm not entirely convinced by the argument about the distinction with Comment  ]reply[06:36, 7 August 2023 (UTC)) talk (Jonathan GroßPerhaps it would be prudent to restrict this property to the pre-Gutenberg era where ee are dealing with very fragmented corpora so the state of transmission is an important piece of information.
