  rdfs:comment "Dictionary entries 12:51, 11 June 2017 (UTC), XXN notable and allowed in Wikidata? I don't think so. By me, they are much like wiktionary pages about words/definitions which aren't allowed in WD at the moment. What do other think? --Q30189424, Q30194711, Q30194708Are such items like  for dictionary entries originating from Russian wikisource (all of them part of this series):~27000 itemsUpdate; this query shows that at the moment there are  19:00, 11 June 2017 (UTC), XXN, or even a RFC? --WD:PCIf it's not very obivous to accept or not such items, maybe is the case to start a broader discussion at  [1]I've asked first the author about these items, then notified him about this discussion, but seems that he isn't interested to participate in this discussion, but keeps building such useless (IMO) items. 13:52, 11 June 2017 (UTC) Jura--- I think the general question may be if Wikisource is a good fit for Wikidata or if it wouldn't be served better by a Wikibase installation of its own. Other than that, there isn't really a big difference between these and other WS items.  12:59, 11 June 2017 (UTC), XXNNote: this discussion will affect thousands of similar items (the 3 items listed above are part of a series). --"@en;
