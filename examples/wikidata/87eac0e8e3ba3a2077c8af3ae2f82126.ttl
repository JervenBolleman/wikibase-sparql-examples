  rdfs:comment "Dams and reservoirs 21:24, 25 January 2018 (UTC)) talk (Thierry Caro. Would you be kind enough to check a few of them and add the missing property if they do have a match? Some merging and splitting will be necessary in quite a few occasions. (P625)coordinate location  set but with reservoirs nearby according to their (P4661)reservoir created  is a (probably poorly written) request that returns a list of dams with no HereHello. 22:23, 25 January 2018 (UTC)) talk (TagishsimonThat's a pretty damn fantastic query, Thierry Caro. --08:35, 26 January 2018 (UTC)) talk (Thierry CaroThanks. I've been separating dams and reservoirs whenever I had time.  22:56, 25 January 2018 (UTC)) talk (AhoerstemeierQuite a nice to-do-list. Seems a lot of them still have instance of set to both reservoir and dam, since most Wikipedias do not separate these two concepts. Hi, I also thought about that problem and I wondered about the whole made of the dam and its reservoir. I think the entity composed of the dam and its reservoir could have its class, if it does not have yet. Actually the following query shows a number of candidates, by searching for each dam who are part of an entity the classes of that entity :"@en;
