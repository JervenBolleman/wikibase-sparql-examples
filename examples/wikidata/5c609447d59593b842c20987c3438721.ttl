Q36977#P487It's correct on  21:21, 9 September 2019 (UTC) JuraSame for the others I checked. The ones in parentheses are fine. --- 10:02, 17 September 2019 (UTC) JuraCan you create the ticket and liaise with the team? (AFAIK that is your role as community liaison). I suppose WMF has several full stack developers. ---  07:57, 17 September 2019 (UTC)) talk (Lea Lacroix (WMDE)At the moment, there is no dedicated person at WMF working on the Query Service. Things should evolve in the next months. Thanks for your patience.  11:05, 16 September 2019 (UTC) JuraI can try to delete and re-add them, but that might hinder checks on your side. I think the same happened with some aliases. Hope there is no bug in the export functions. Just figured out why you wouldn't ping Stas.

Pinging should work here too. ---  10:55, 12 September 2019 (UTC)) talk (Lea Lacroix (WMDE)I had a look but couldn't find any explaination. Would you mind creating a Phab task so I can ping some people who could help?  05:24, 12 September 2019 (UTC) JuraIs this a problem with server load or the export function? --- Thanks for investigating this and coming up with a test for it:"@en;
