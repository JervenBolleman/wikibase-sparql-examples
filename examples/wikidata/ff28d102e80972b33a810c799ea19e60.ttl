  rdfs:comment "Bulk deletion request: 543 recently created items on legislation are all for \"Zakon o za≈°titi prirode\" act of the same country. Possibly a few of these items can be converted to an item on particular legislative act which already doesn't have Wikidata item, but then again going through all of them one by one is probably not worth the effort and it's easier create items for some mentioned legislative acts later if needed. As these 543 items are unlinked then I think it's reasonable and safe to just delete them. Another around 350 items (excluded from the following query) originating from the same source database field are linked and need further attention. Q108052798, Q108059945, Q108053019, Q108061580, Q108062713 (linked). Some apparently are duplicate as many times as they occur in source database, e.g. Q108065223 (unlinked) and Q108052947. Some source database fields apparently have been imported multiple times, e.g. identical Special:Diff/1487860134 qualifier, e.g. here: (P958)section, verse, paragraph, or clause . This arbitrary text generally includes comments (clarifying notes, selection of paragraphs, URL or alike) in addition to actual title(s) of legislative act(s). I've corrected some links to use previously existing items using (Q1116062)Nationally designated areas inventory  as part of a botched data import. Each of these items corresponds to an arbitrary text in \"legalReferenceName\" field of User:OleaThe following query currently yields 543 unlinked items, that were recently created by"@en;
