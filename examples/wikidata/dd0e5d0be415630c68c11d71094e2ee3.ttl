  rdfs:comment "16:43, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (InductiveloadAre people using queries that that would be impractical for?  ) to farm out to a separate, dedicated item? Specific templates can follow a relevant property (e.g. probably some kind of generic \"has data series\", qualified as needed) to the list and then happily inhale as much as it wants from there. Meanwhile, the actual item itself is not accruing a unbounded amount of data (multiplied by the number of \"heavy\" items certain projects want to use).(Q99374)(E)-p-coumaric acid  (e.g. see (P703)found in taxon , not specifically for this exact ELO thing. Would it make more sense to farm out data-series like this (and other \"heavy\" uses like the famous Comment More general  16:31, 29 September 2021 (UTC) JuraActually, I don't mind the periodical updates. The frequency is IMHO debatable. I (still) find the additions after a person died problematic. I thought we had stopped with that. For some uses, I just skip chess players. Occasionally, it happens that this drops a person that is otherwise notable. ---  15:33, 30 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (SteakOkay, for this usecase this might be fine. Still, for ratings lists of a given month, all ratings of that month are needed.  23:20, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Inductiveload you only need a data point when the value changes, so all the intermediate points are redundant. interpolate: step-after Specifically, with Steak@ 16:38, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (SteakYes, maybe, I don't know how this works exactly.  16:32, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Inductiveload for an example. https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/line-chart/ is what you need somewhere in there? See interpolate: step-after presumably there should be no diagonal lines, because the rating is not only merely not-everywhere-smooth but actually discontinuous. So probably Steak@ 16:38, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (SteakYou simply don't know what people need. Why would you not need a top Elo list of a given rating period? You cannot simply say \"We don't need it\". Currently the possibility is there, and you want to destroy it without need. And regarding the Graph: No, if the graphs shows a line at rating 2700, when in reality the rating was 2750, then the graph is at least misleading.  16:30, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Игорь Темиров\"Which would be of of course wrong\" - Not at all, the graph only shows the trend, and not the super-accurate value of the rating.  Why do we need the top 100 Elo, for example, for January 2009? 16:16, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Steak, it is even more apparent, that the line would be wrongly diagonal if the constant ratings between January 2005 and October 2008 would be removed. de:Template:Elo-Diagramm: If all ratings between February 2020 and November 2020 would be missing, there would be a diagonal line between January 2020 and January 2021. Which would be of of course wrong. For Bent Larsen on the page de:Sergei_Alexandrowitsch_Karjakin: If a rating is removed, the connection line between the ratings is not anymore straight, but skewed, because the intermedia rating is missing.

Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Botshouldn't this discussion be at 15:33, 30 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (SteakSure, if the Thread Opener wants to do changes in big scale, he should apply for a bot. The ratings for September appeared. Summing up some of the discussion: Replaces the link to the FIDE's player card with the link to the regular rating list of FIDE (example, Q108360564) or olimpbase-file (Q108680205).

I'm very surprised we decided to keep clearly non-notable people. Игорь Темиров@ 17:17, 3 October 2021 (UTC)) talk (Игорь Темиров: Thanks. All this has already been discussed above. Except for deleting. A request for deletion was submitted, but did not find support. But, as I wrote above, I will not add chess players without titul in the future. BrokenSegue@ 16:42, 3 October 2021 (UTC)) talk (BrokenSegue. Q108686706. Looking at your history I see lots of bot edits without approval. Sorting ELO statements is not valuable. Also can you go and nominate all the non-notable items you created for deletion.

Make sure all your Elo links from these chess players are going nowhere. These are only grandmasters and only for the last two years. What to do with your links that have stopped working?! But you can still find it in the rating lists. Of course, replacing links with more reliable ones is needed.

If we know the ID of a chess player, then we will find it in the rating list. But if his card has disappeared, then your link leads nowhere. For example, grandmasters  13:45, 3 October 2021 (UTC)) talk (Steak. If you look at an Elo list, how would you distinguish between them? In this case, you could use the DoB, but this might be missing or even be the same. The only unique identifier is the ID, and therefore it is needed for every single statement. For this usecase, it does not matter if the profile page still exists or not. (Q27530048)Roman Popov  and (Q27530047)Roman Popov I don't agree to the sorting and to the last point. Sorting is not needed. If you sort without changing the statements, I actually don't care if you do it or not. But don't remove retrieval date and the FIDE-IDs in the references. They are needed. For example, take !): (P585)point in time . There is no problem in that, but the query will be slower because you need a filter (unlike for (P582)end time  and (P580)start time  wrote \"How would you modify it?\" I would simply add tests for Steak"@en;
