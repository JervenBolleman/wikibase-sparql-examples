  rdfs:comment "Discussion) (Q461572)SoHo An initialism should be just initials, so Orange is a bad example. It includes acronyms (which you should be able to pronounce as words), but also tongue-twisting jumbles of letters. Its key requirement is that its a sequence of initial letters extracted from a title that are commonly used to describe it. Normally all capitals, but sometimes mixed (eg  (\"Foreign Office\", \"FCO\", \"FCDO\" ect) (Q358834)Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office  (United States, States, US, USA), or organisation like the (Q30)United States of America  are initialisms, but not all, and it will help for countries like (P1813)short name Some  ]reply[10:26, 30 August 2024 (UTC)) talk (Vicarage qualifier to the existing property.

There are various ways to make abbreviations which are not initialisms, and a single abbreviation can combine more than one method. Those would not belong in this property and creating a separate property for every single type (and combination of types) that can be used would make the data hard to enter/use.
