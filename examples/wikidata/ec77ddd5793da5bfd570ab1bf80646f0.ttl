You need to stare at this until it makes sense, no matter how long it takes :) data model diagramGetting qualifier or reference data for properties of items is a bit confusing until it clicks. The key to the whole thing (for me, at least) is the Getting a property value is easy. You ask the report service for the wdt: value. You can see that on the diagram - start in the item circle, follow the wdt: arrow line, and arrive at the simple value. You can also see from the same diagram that there's nowhere you can go from the simple value; you are at journey's end. If you want a Property Qualifier, you need to ask for a pq: value. To do that, you need to follow the path from the item circle to the statement circle using the p: path. From the statement circle you can then take a variety of paths, such as the ps: path (which will give you the same value as the wdt: path did) or the pq: path which will give you the simple value for the qualifier. The statement itself is just a long & unique URI cobbled together by wikidata, the only purpose of which is to allow things like qualifiers to be hung from it.  items: YYYY Sweet Adelines International chorus competitionSo in report terms, it looks kinda like this (and here I'm reporting on the set of"@en,
