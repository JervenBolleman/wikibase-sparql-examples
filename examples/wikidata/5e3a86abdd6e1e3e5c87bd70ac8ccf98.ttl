The vast majority have actual names and some have good descriptions, which are very helpful for quickly understanding exactly which ship this is. Those that you have touched (currently ~15), only have labels saying \"IMO xxxxxxx\". Nothing that could possibly ring a bell to a normal human being. While your system may appear \"logical\" to you, it unfortunately ignores the needs of other wikidata users.--]reply[15:24, 30 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (HjartI find it very usefull.-- ]reply[12:18, 30 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (Wolfgang FrickeWhat a mess for a data base!--, which explains labels and the purpose of them. You can also just use the name under which the ship is or was most commonly known and list less commonly used names as aliases. Please note that IMO numbers are not names and should never be used as labels. Help:LabelPlease see 1. Why should the last name be the best choice? Regarding the \"MOL Elbe\", it is not the current name as she was scrapped long ago. Sometimes a ship served long with a famous name and served the last years under another name for a different company. In extreme cases the name is changed when the ship is sold to the breakers - often simply deleting one or more letters. I cannot see any advantage to use such names in many cases.  For me it is no problem if I am convinced of a better system. But I still don't understand the following: ]reply[21:34, 28 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (Hjart.--Wikidata:Project chatI strongly recommend that you scrap the system you've been following and seek advice on how to design a better system over at  ]reply[21:09, 28 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (Hjart. commons:Category:IMO 8912247\" (or whatever it's called in your language) in the lower part of the infobox in authority data belong in the label section.

Some data, i.e. the photo, does not refer to \"MOL Elbe\", but to the ship with IMO 8912247!  It was not right from you to delete the photo of \"Elbe\" from the Wikidata description!

When creating the Wikidata Infobox on the page of a category IMO ..., then the IMO number appears as label. This is systematic.
