Could you confirm you will be doing it in the next days? Thanks, --one by one). It is difficult to evaluate the extent of the errors, but as far as I have seen correcting tens of items it would better checking items stricto sensu are extremely valuable for the improvement of Wikidata items, the evident errors of points 1 2 3 can be seriously damaging (while 4 is disappointing but not damaging (Q2822396)Academy of Sciences of Turin Whilst data from ]reply[11:58, 30 December 2020 (UTC) dosisEpì. --Wikidata:Bot_requests#Accademia_delle_Scienze_di_Torino_multiple_references: OK, bot request done: Marco Chemello (TOAS)@ ]reply[10:54, 30 December 2020 (UTC)) talk (Marco Chemello (TOAS): are actually working to fix the problems in the entities (not a lot in %, but there are) where there are different dates/places between Wikidata sources and Accademia DB.

Unfortunately we dont't have an easy solution for the references issues (apart from fixing them manually), as we are using QuickStatements and it's limited in this.
