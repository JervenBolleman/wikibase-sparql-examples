  rdfs:comment "SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en\". } to output lemma? 10:20, 16 November 2019 (UTC) JuraWhen using ?entity ?entityLabel, this gives the label for items (and properties), but nothing for lexemes. I wonder if it shouldn't output the (or a) lemma. ---   14:11, 18 November 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONYes we can, launch an other discussion and give the link if you want. Cheers,  13:46, 18 November 2019 (UTC) JuraMaybe we can discuss this elsewhere. It's really for the dev team. ---  12:47, 18 November 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONObviously not but this is not about me: why do *you* require it? And everything is connected, if someone else use something slowing down the whole system, it affects everyone. So if you want something slower, less efficient and less easy, you need to provide a good reason. If you have a good reason then maybe I could reconsider but until then I don't see why it should be done. Cheers,  10:00, 18 November 2019 (UTC) JuraDon't worry, you wont be required to use it .. ---  08:17, 18 November 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERON?lemma is also simple (and more simple I would say) and UNION is a totally different thing not needed to get the label or the lemma. Cheers,  19:11, 17 November 2019 (UTC) Jura?entityLabel is simple .. much more than some complex UNION query. ---  18:59, 17 November 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONCheers,  Plus, the service label syntax is very expensive (causing a lot of time out) and is actually a shorcut for the long syntax of quarying the label but the syntax for lemma is very short, why wanting a shorcut longer than the actual syntax?: that's very very strange. In effect, this idea is that \"label\" is - more or less - same as \"lemma\". This doesn't sound a good idea for many reasons which boild down to \"label and lemma are not the same\" and they doesn't even behave in the same way : item have usually a lot of label, lexeme only have few lemma ; label exist usually in a lot of language on an item, lemma are usually in a few languages on a lexeme, and so on. In a nushell, my point of view is that label and lemma are too fare different to be called the same. Jura1:@   user discussion to be continued elsewhere  07:29, 2 December 2019 (UTC) Jura: what's your take on this? --- Lydia Pintscher (WMDE), Lea Lacroix (WMDE)@08:46, 2 December 2019 (UTC) JuraHow did you determine that? Why should it work differently than other entities? ---  08:33, 2 December 2019 (UTC)) talk (Lea Lacroix (WMDE)The current way to query for lemmas is working well and doesn't require the expensibe wikibase:label service. I don't see any reason to change it."@en;
