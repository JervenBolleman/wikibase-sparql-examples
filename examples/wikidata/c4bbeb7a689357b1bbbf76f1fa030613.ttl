  rdfs:comment "Why are (some) Gene Ontology protein complexes (cellular components) also instances of family of protein complexes (Q78155096)?This is a temporary solution but not very wrong. Contrary to Complex Portal entries and Reactome protein complexes, Gene Ontology complexes are species-independent, so if the set of all complexes that are defined by such an entry is homologous then it is a family. Of course the condition is that the parts are always the same, i.e. they are from the same protein families. This can change and make sub-entries necessary later. However, at the moment this slowly growing part of Wikidata is to our knowledge the only existing database of species-independent protein complexes linking them to their parts families. For an overview, there are currently 2,579 complexes in GO. We have annotated the parts of 35 of them, and encourage you to add those you are interested in. Query:"@en;
