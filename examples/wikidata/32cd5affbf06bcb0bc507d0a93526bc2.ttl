  rdfs:comment "Notability of chess players ]reply[14:23, 24 October 2016 (UTC)) talk (SteakIn my opinion, untitled players are not notable for wikidata. Such players are hobby players, and with ratings down to 1200 Elo, every young adult could have such a rating and hence a FIDE rating card, there is nothig special about it. We would flood wikidata with thousends of completely irrelevant people. Other opinions? ]reply[18:09, 24 October 2016 (UTC)) talk (Wesalius was a one time error, no intention in creating items for low rating players. --Q27478560 ]reply[14:33, 24 October 2016 (UTC)) talk (Steak.

I created items for players with elo above 2300. That is all, I am not creating items for players below that elo (as you are implicating). -- ]reply[09:19, 24 May 2017 (UTC)) talk (SteakWe should define some notability guidelines for chess players. My suggestions: Notable are all players with GM, IM, FM, WGM, WIM, and WFM FIDE titles and all players that won a national championship or (especially historically) an important tournament. Equivalently these criteria should apply to the correspondence chess players. Further players may be notable, but this is then an individual decision. This query yields all chess players without a title statement and without sitelinks. Most of them should qualify for deletion:"@en;
