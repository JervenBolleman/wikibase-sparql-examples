  rdfs:comment "Distinct values"@en, "synonyms abd their referencesHello, if either you intend to improve your tool alec-demo.herokuapp.com you should think to retrieve the list of synonym(s) of a taxon, but also, and very important the reference linked to those synonym.  ]reply[08:32, 9 May 2021 (UTC)) talk (Christian Ferrer, that have a given reference for the first description. It would be great if the both pages could be linked one each other and if below the section \"reference\" we could have a kind of section \"reference for the synonyms\" automatically generated.

I suspect the query will require some finessing given the numerous ways we have to represent synonyms and links to references. --https://github.com/rdmpage/alec/issues/9: Good idea, I've created an issue for this Christian Ferrer@(P2868)subject has role All the taxa items using Just by curiosity look at those both queries:"@en;
