  rdfs:comment "SkjoldnaesHello Hjart, you have reverted the Wikidata Infobox on the IMO-page of above ship by replacing the IMO number by the ship name. This is not correct. As far as I understood the pages, the Infobox on the IMO-page shall be independent of the ship name, as the latter can change several times during the ship's life. Therefore, the IMO number is given as identifyer, which does not change under different ship names. On the other hand, the ship category (Skjoldnaes, ship ...) with its Infobox is labeled with the ship name, however, referencing to the a.m. Infobox so that data have to be changed or inserted only once.  ]reply[07:45, 28 August 2021 (UTC)) talk (Wolfgang FrickeI know that several infoboxes still do not follow this rule, however it is the logical way and I ask you to follow this also.--The query: ]reply[14:45, 28 August 2021 (UTC)) talk (Wolfgang FrickeSorry, Hjart, I do not agree. Even if the Infobox on the IMO-Wikimedia page gets the label with IMO number, there will be an Infobox on the Skjoldnaes-Wikimedia-page having the ship name in the label, and the link to the Danish Wikipedia page is still there. Of course, in case of this ship there is (up to now) only one ship name, but problems arise in case of more than one name, as outlined above.-- ]reply[07:55, 28 August 2021 (UTC)) talk (Hjart was originally named after the danish wikipedia article. It's not an IMO page. Also I think the Commons IMO categories makes linking wp ship articles with their Commons categories horribly unintuitive.--(Q12325488)Skjoldn√¶s : Please note that the item Wolfgang Fricke@"@en;
