You have been adding the (unsourced and vague) information that a number of scientists were indeed scientists. This is useless when the precise subject(s) are already here. Moreover in the French Wikipedia (and in other langages as well) the template « Biographie2 » directly imports assertions from wikidata in the infobox. In the case of Johann Euler your addition presented him as « Mathématicien, astronome, physicien, scientifique » , the last precision being of course redundant and totally useless (and weird). ]reply[20:17, 19 January 2020 (UTC)) talk (Lewoniewski (not directly in class \"scientist\").--Q188094I putted example below (SPARQL query), to show why this approach is incomplete and sometimes can give wrong results.
