  rdfs:comment "What to do when given name is actually not a given nameHi, We have a constraint which says that the given name should be a given name. In 99% of the cases, there is absolutely no problem. ) which kind of make sens but break the constraint. Sarah Layton (added by (Q676555)Francis of Assisi (P735)given name (Q154308)Manuel II of Portugal  so right now we have Francisco de Assis has for 11th given name (Q154308)Manuel II of Portugal But sometimes, people have for given name, the name of an other people. For instance, How should we proceed in such cases?  ]reply[10:51, 25 June 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONCdlt, ]reply[13:27, 5 September 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERON so all is good now. Cheers, (Q66659034)Francisco de Assis Bezerra de Menezes  and used on Pablo Busatto was created by (Q66659044)Francisco de Assis I was a bit skeptic to create a name for only one person ; then  ]reply[17:32, 25 June 2019 (UTC)) talk (Yair randSimple: Remove the incorrect value and replace it with an actual item for the name. If there isn't one yet, one can be created. (This is assuming that it's actually a given name, and not just the names \"Francisco\" and \"de Assis\".) -- ]reply[13:27, 5 September 2019 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONI think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment.    ]reply[ Shouldn't we impose a constraint that the target of P735:\"given name\" actually is a \"given name\" (instance of Q202444)? There are many cases not satisfying this constraint, and they are all wrong from my point of view. Either they contain a country (user's mistake), or something different, like for example Q345:\"Virgin Mary\" (obviously intentional vandalism):14:19, 11 February 2020 (UTC)) talk (Zbmath authorid--"@en;
