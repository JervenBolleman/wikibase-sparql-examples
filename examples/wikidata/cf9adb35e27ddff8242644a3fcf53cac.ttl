  rdfs:comment "Number of species names that are not synonyms 22:28, 7 February 2018 (UTC)) talk (HYanWongI'm looking for a rough estimate of the number of \"biological species\" in wikidata (i.e. not including synonyms etc). At the risk of starting an argument, can anyone help me with an SparQL query which doesn't simply count the number of names/concepts? 14:15, 8 February 2018 (UTC)) talk (HYanWong homotypic synonym (Q42310380), but I presume that in general, I can't rely on all synonymous names being marked with Q1040689 - they might just have one of the subtypes set. So is there a list somewhere of all the different types of synonym that might be applied to a taxon? And how misleading would the end result be anyway? and. Also, I see that some names are marked e.g. as both synonym (Q1040689) WD:RAQMany thanks.
