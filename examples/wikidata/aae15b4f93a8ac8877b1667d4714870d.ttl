A cylindrical projection is both an instance of and a subclass of map projection. (The cylindrical projection was also fixed on 1 July 2020.) Is that trying to say there is a trivial cylindrical projection, and there are other, more complicated, projections? But then there should be two items: one for the instance and one for the class. We are back to the typeface problem. ) makes more sense. I have trouble with a system that leads to an instance of an instance. A map might use an instance of a Mercator projection which is itself an instance of a map projection. If I want to make a list of different map projections, then a query that asks for all instances* of a map projection would return the instance that map used. That is not the answer I want. If Mercator projection were a subclass of map projection, then I'd ask for all subclasses* of map projection. I should get the Mercator projection without specific instances of the Mercator projection. (P279)subclass of Using subclass of ("@en;
