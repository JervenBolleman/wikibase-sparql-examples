  rdfs:comment "Items with DOI (P356) that start with 10.1023/A: without a Label or a title (P1476) is such an item. Q58391055. I'm not sure what is causing this. That's a problem far from my skills to resolve. I have followed the DOI of these items and added the journal article's title to the item's label and title, but there are so many. I'm not even sure one couldn't create yet another item with that DOI using SourceMD (resulting in another item to fix). Example, (P1476)title  that start with 10.1023/A: without a Label or a (P356)DOI There are quite a few items with , I can create a table to generate a correction through QuickStatement. (P1476)title  that start with 10.1023/A: without a Label or a (P356)DOI Can someone create a list for me that has the QID and the DOI (as a link, preferably) for those items with  01:53, 4 July 2021 (UTC)) talk (TrilotatIf anyone can prevent this from continuing to happen, it would be nice to think there's a list that I can correct and it won't continue to add new items without a title. Thank you, 13:16, 4 July 2021 (UTC) Jura has a title-statement, but that doesn't really help.

This is working better than expected! I have been able to update a few hundred items very quickly working through your list. I then went on to find other journals published by SpringerLink plugged into your query. Thanks so much. I'll keep looking for examples and then chasing down others published in that journal. Jura1@ 16:05, 4 July 2021 (UTC)) talk (Trilotat: Thank you! Hey, did you provide an example of items in that specific journal as an example? It works for me, but I was hoping for ALL journals. If you limited to items that are scholarly articles, that might limit some. Did you limit to a specific journal because otherwise it times out? Thanks again, I can address these pretty quickly now so thank you so much. Jura1@For the query, I used that journal as it was in your sample. Apparently \"10.1023\" could be any Springer publication.

Truth is, though, every time I run this, it seems to add previously unseen items to repair. After a few days and running it again and again, I just ran it and got NO results.
