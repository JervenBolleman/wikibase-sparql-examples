Property:P1971: Re \"seems annoying and unfamiliar with wikidata\" - I see no evidence that asking the question made when starting this section could lead to \"seems annoying and unfamiliar with wikidata\". I work on human data, and the claim child=\"no value\" is something I have not seen before, despite having seen hundreds of pages. Of course it can exist in large quantities in WD, but it has not been applied to every human that has no child. So, I asked for the source at the talk, user did not provide it, so I went here. But if you are less \"annoying and unfamiliar\" than me, please share, in which cases such statement should be made to further the goals of the WMF in sharing knowledge to world. Thousands of humans can receive it. And last but not least, explain the difference from simply stating \"number of children = 0\" via BrokenSegue@"@en;
