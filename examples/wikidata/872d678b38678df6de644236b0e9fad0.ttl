I tried on So, what do we do, now, to clean up this mess, and try and remove this OBSOLETE property ? Is there any way to ease this ? or shall it be done by human-hand-eye processing onlyâ€¦ and last for as long as the removal of old P107 property ?  21:13, 2 December 2015 (UTC)) talk (HsarrazinThanks for any tool suggested to try and ease this process. --19:23, 3 December 2015 (UTC)) talk (Innocent bystander: I already replace this property when I come across it, but I do not search for it on a daily basis.

This is a phabricator bug (T78006) (P357)P357 : We can't do an automatic conversion because we don't have the language value as statement. We could define the language from the language of the work in some case.
