  rdfs:comment "FIDE rankings ]reply[02:40, 15 May 2018 (UTC)) talk (Hrodvarsson each month, as I believe it is useful for this information to be accessible without leaving Wikipedia. Is there a means of automating this process, or to record the data here so it could simply replicated across other languages? The English and Russian Wikipedia are the only languages with up-to-date rankings. FIDE world rankingsI have been updating : I don't think this is possible at the moment.

I have little experience on Wikidata so I don't know if this possible, but the idea seems useful to me. Q106807: Thanks. That de-wiki template is also useful but what I meant was the creation of a template on Wikidata that could be transcluded onto all languages of Wikipedia. The template would contain the same data as the wikitable currently seen on en-wiki FIDE world rankings, except with en-wiki article links replaced with Wikidata links.

If not, please be more precise. de:Vorlage:Elo-Diagramm: because yours did probably not work. What you are looking for is probably something similar to the Edgars2007: Another ping for @Hrodvarsson@ ]reply[19:48, 1 September 2018 (UTC)) talk (Hrodvarsson: Thanks for the reply and sorry for the late response (I must have missed the ping). What I meant was a template that could be transcluded in other languages of Wikipedia, so if I were to update the rankings here it would apply across all languages, rather than just updating the rankings on en-wiki. Similar to updating a wikidata infobox would apply to articles that contain the wikidata infobox. Edgars2007@ ]reply[15:52, 26 May 2018 (UTC)) talk (Edgars2007: Currently updating the rankings.
