(P118)league or competition  I see, I think I was misunderstanding you. You mean that it doesn't make sense to have the exact same start and time for every statistical property - it would just be repeating information that is obviously the same. Yes, that's a completely fair point, and one I had thought of too. So if we can make statements for each hockey player about their participation in the NHL, when we say that each statistic was achieved in the NHL, the time is inferred. Do I have that correct?

Wikidata is a technical storage of information that is only required to be prepared for presentation in a readable form, we should strive for the most optimal solutions.

If we say \"Gretzky scored 894 points between 1979 and 1999,\" we don't need any more information to understand what is meant. While it would be correct to use hockey seasons, if we could find a way to make it work, this more complex schema is not absolutely necessary right now to convey the information. I would rather have this data up and available in a simpler form than not have it available at all because of technicalities. Also, I have the start and end time data for all these players as years right now, and I do not have the capacity to capture the exact date with month and year that each individual player scored their first and last goals. So I am going to upload this data, but I would be more than happy if someone came along after me to flesh it out with exact dates.

I looked at a few other players and it appears that the career start date data is consistently one year later.

So these are the seasons he played in, the span of his career, and that's what I've uploaded. Adding the exact dates of the first and last goals is not what I had intended to represent with the start time and end time qualifiers, only that between the start of his career in the NHL and the end of his career, these are his stats. I think this time frame is more significant, because that's important to know that he played for some time after February 10, 2001, but never scored a goal - there was a significant time of his career where he was trying to score, but never scored. You had mentioned before that a separate property would be useful for \"date of most recent value change\" - that would be different from \"end time.\" What do you think?

If not found means it is zero, then that includes Justin Bieber, as you said before. Also, if a player did not score any goals, simply not including a statement for goals just looks like someone forgot to include information.

Plus, looking at the dataset as a whole, it is meaningful to see that a number of players have zeros in some categories as compared to those that have positive integers. standard presentation of stats qualifier for any of his statements. Put another way, we can't always worry about defining every single negative statement: on Justin Bieber's page, we wouldn't list everything he hasn't done or everything that he isn't, that would be absurd. On the other hand, it is meaningful that an NHL player actually played in the NHL, had an opportunity to record a statistic, and failed to do so.
