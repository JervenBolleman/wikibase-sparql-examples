  rdfs:comment "Network of co-players 16:45, 31 August 2022 (UTC)) talk (Cavernia. However, replacing the property is not enough as the authors are listed in items of the scientific articles, while teams are listed in the athlete items. How do I change the query then? --(P54)member of sports team  most often played together with in other teams by using (Q215944)Tore Andr√© Flo  to show which co-authors a researcher has published most often together with. I'd like to do the same with athletes, i.e. I want to show the co-players queryFrom Scholia, there is a nice 19:19, 31 August 2022 (UTC)) talk (Dipsacus fullonum in 1999, so they never played together on the team.

It doesn't help that query you're linking to doesn't show which co-authors a researcher has published most often together with, but instead shows which other affiliations items with a certain affiliation also have. Please explain again. I don't see how to tell how often someone has played with others by using P54. --Cavernia@: Here is as promised a query. Is it what you wanted? Cavernia @"@en;
