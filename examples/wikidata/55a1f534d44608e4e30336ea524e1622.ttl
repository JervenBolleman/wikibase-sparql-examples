  rdfs:comment "User Script to warn about conflicting superclasses now working! an idea of mine to make a Gadget that warned editors when they changed an items basic superclasses (i.e. changed an item from being a process to an object, or a spatial entity to a temporal entity). I've now written it (at least a first version), and got it to a point where I'd appreciate wider feedback. It checks each time a new item is selected when changing an instance-of or subclass-of value, and makes a bubble notification if a conflict is identified. (For now, for debugging, it also displays a notification if no problems are seen, but I plan to remove that.) previously wrote on Project Chat aboutI'd : Special:MyPage/common.jsYou can try it out just by adding the following to your mw.loader.load('//www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User:JesseW/conflicting_superclass_warnings.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript'); // [[User:JesseW/conflicting_superclass_warnings.js]] 03:54, 2 April 2023 (UTC)) talk (JesseWVery glad for any feedback, particularly suggestions for additional conflicting superclasses!
