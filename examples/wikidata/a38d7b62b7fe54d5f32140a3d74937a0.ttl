  rdfs:comment "Wrong gender imported from GND 10:13, 25 May 2020 (UTC) Jura person is obviously female. --- https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q94853704&oldid=1185186853Can you repair this: 12:12, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (M2k~dewiki. DNB seems to have wrong gender data (male instead of female) in at least some cases, even if they show the right (female) form of occupation (e.g. \"Schriftstellerin\" instead of \"Schriftsteller\"). --Q95350494, Q95349608, Q95348529, Q95349834, Q95350061, Q95339302, Q95338703, Q95335213More examples are   17:07, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: before asking others to re-read, can you re-read my question from 16:08 and answer it? Jura1@ 16:17, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraPlease re-read the above. It's not an assumption the value is incorrect, we know it. We don't need low quality fields from databases even if you consider the db \"high quality\" (or is it your edits there?). ---  16:08, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: what does \"that\" in your last sentence refer to? The last lines were about assumed incorrect values, the first mention of \"high quality\" was in relation to the import. Errors in data fields at the source do not change the quality of an import. Nor do errors in some data fields mean that a whole database is not of high quality. Jura1@ 14:01, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraOk, so we don't really know how GND determines gender and it's just something that \"someone with write access to GND added it that way\". How can that be considered \"high quality\"? ---  13:57, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder Why was is added to GND DB despite being judged wrong: Because someone with write access to GND added it that way. Why is it judged to be wrong: a possible answer because it contradicts what the first name implies and what is stored in occupation - but note the occupation field could also be wrong: \"why\" in the above questions can mean at least two kinds of questions Jura1@ 13:50, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraSo why is the gender for the above people incorrect at GND? ---  13:48, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: You may think so, but he didn't. Anyway, where is the system behind what you claim to be a \"systematic issue\"? Jura1@ 13:45, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraI think M2k explained it to you. Maybe you want to do a root cause analysis for all samples given above. As long as this isn't done, the source can't be considered high quality for this property. ---  13:42, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: you still didn't share the system, where is it? The high quality import was correct. Wikidata exists to store information found in reliable sources. GND is regarded as a reliable source. Jura1@ 13:38, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraNo, as any other contributor, we expect you to first try to fix your import, then, if you need help, we can try to sort it out. ---  13:35, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: if you see there is a system behind the issue, then please share it here. Of course you can also fix. Jura1@ 17:11, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraAnd what constraint did I violate? ---  17:09, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: You created new humans without sex. Jura1@ 13:48, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraSo what's the constraint violation I added? ---  13:46, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: No, I am not. And to claim that I confuse something is a personal attack. Please refrain from making such statements. Jura1@ 13:43, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraI think you are confusing your edits with mine. As this is the talk page of P227 it's very likely. ---  13:40, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: before attacking high quality imports made by new users, you could for a starter have a look at the constrained violations that you add and your creation of duplicated imports. Jura1@ 13:33, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraI think it highlights problems contributors have to take in account and that large scale imports aren't suitable for new contributors as starters. ---  13:28, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (M2k~dewiki, ...). This might give a list with items which should be checked. --Q1087262, Ursula Q18087887, most first names are unique for one gender, e.g. Rosemarie Q18177321 or female Q18177306A possible additional plausibility check for all data could be a check for the first name. While same first names are possible for both genders (e.g. \"Andrea\" could be male  13:25, 25 May 2020 (UTC) JuraApparently it's a systematic issue (cf. above the report by another use). Apparently you are aware of the quality issue. Please double check your import and fix problem we identified. ---   13:18, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: what do you think? Of course one can also compare whole lists of items. Regarding occupation information: Not always do they have only the female occupation, have seen at least having female and male form, where I wondered if the person has changed sex during their life. M2k~dewiki, Kolja21. Take and give: WD takes from GND but also can give back. @[2]Seen and fixed on other items before. A way to have the information available and prevent re-import is to deprecate the statement instead of removing  13:20, 25 May 2020 (UTC)) talk (MrProperLawAndOrder: it's a wiki, you can deprecate the statement and provide what you think is correct.
