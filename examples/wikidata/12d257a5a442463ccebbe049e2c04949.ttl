But wouldn't it be better to improve the modelling of the war items instead? Country items are already notoriously cluttered and this would add dozens of statements to those. Comment ]reply[04:37, 23 September 2020 (UTC)  The Erinaceous One ðŸ¦”, there are dozens of wars and many of the wars have multiple opponents. Additionally, since many wars involve more than two countries, using the proposed property would lead to an extreme amount of redundancy as each combatant would need to be duplicated for each country on the opposing side. If four countries are allied against three countries, then this property would require 24 statements (4x3+4x3), whereas putting this information all on one page should only need seven statements. â€”the list of wars the USA has fought is right that this would add many statements to country items.
