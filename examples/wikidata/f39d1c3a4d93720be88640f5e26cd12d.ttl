If case2 = true, then one (or I) could ask the IEEE to provide a list of their digital library, since it includes more than 4.2 Million articles (main subject: electrical and electronic engineering). I hope this can be done soon. Thanks again!--Mahir256Thanks for the answers.

But therefore I must show them how awesome it is for science and for our department there. Therefore, a great collection with as much and as complete data as possible is desired in order to success. Any help will be appreciated! --: thanks. Unfortunately this would not help at all, too large output without any match.Q.Zanden listed in Wikidata - this sparql query lists them, and you can check similar queries for other engineering journals:(Q2331335)Journal of Biomechanical Engineering  - Most of the scientific articles in Wikidata have been added from PubMed and so are in bio-medical and life-sciences.
