FYI yesterday I asked BFI if it's possible to prove a map from BFI identifier to ChoiceFilmWorks ID. It will be interesting to see what they say. From the above discussion above it looks there may be no simple map :-(  ]reply[17:27, 17 October 2023 (UTC)) talk (GreenC. Excellent, simply search EIDR for all Wikidata IDs, then update Wikidata with the new BFI ID when EIDR has it. Then it would be possible to update Wikipedia links, because we also have the old BFI IDs in Wikidata. Same process, search Wikipedia for all old BFI ID and then search Wikidata for that old ID and from there retrieve the new ID and update the URL. Easier said than done, of course, but a path exists. -- Q3569872 and a Wikidata of 150047127 shows the new BFI as 1931 version. The all the versions, here are Birds of a Feather might be able to figure this out at scale.

I believe the BFI ID is 23135 because in Expert Search choose \"BFI Reference Number\" and enter 23135, it goes to the page for the work in the /ChoiceFilmWorks/150027925 URL. However entering a BFI Reference Number of 150027925 doesn't work. This is unfortunate because there is no way to map the BFI ID of 23135 to the URL of /ChoiceFilmWorks/150027925 .. it's like you need to know both numbers, one a BFI ID the other a \"URL ID\" - if that's what it is, and assuming that number even remains stable over time.this page .. there are 2 possible BFI identifiers: 150027925 and 23135. https://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150027925As for the new IDs, here is an example URL:  As for Wikidata, because the original ID and database system is in-effect no longer in existence, it should be nuked from Wikidata to avoid confusion. BFI is creating a new database and IDs, but is very different from the old one. There is no map for the new IDs. It will take years or decades for the community to manually determine what the IDs are for each film and actor. (By which time BFI will destroy the DB and make a new one..) What I found was about a 90% dead link rate. Unclear why they kept those 10% working. The template:BFI on enwiki is currently up for deletion after converting to archive URLs (1,200 instances). The same template is deployed in other languages, see above \"This property is being used by\". Those templates need to be converted to archive URLs on each wiki, a huge job requiring bot perms on each., worked on this, on enwiki, for the past 3 days. Fixed over 16,000 links.
