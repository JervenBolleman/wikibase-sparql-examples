I'm not a specialist (I work more often on books in Wikidata), but if I understand correctly, there is right now 2 concurrent methods : (Q1257444)film adaptation  = (P136)genre   = origin work item(P144)based on . The first method is alos more explicit (it says \"this is adapted from this particular work\" while the second one only says \"it adapted from something\"). This method is also more simple and direct. (Q1257444)film adaptation  = (P136)genre  but only 3 793 items have (P144)based on The first method is more common. On 266 493 item on movies (and subclasses) movies, 7 077 have a  (is there any references for this? as an amateur, it feels more like a technic or a process than a genre). (Q201658)film genre  is really a (Q1257444)film adaptation  for films adapted from video games) and I even wonder if (Q1257444)film adaptation , about the question of the use - or not - of Archimëa and El Caro, MovieFexMy point of view, is that we should *only* stick to the first method which seems to me « necessary and sufficient » to model reality (while the second is not necessary nor sufficient). Plus, the second one raised some other problems (see recent discussions with ?). Wikidata:WikiProject Movies/Properties is already here so we don't loose information). And to write it somewhere (maybe (P144)based on  (obviously, after carefull check that the (Q1257444)film adaptation  = (P136)genre All together, I'm proposing to remove all the What do you think?  09:12, 24 April 2018 (UTC)) talk (VIGNERONCdlt, : I agree with you. Only the main genres should be added. I think, some misunderstand \"genre at Wikidata\" and \"Wikipedia category\". Look at this exemple below. There are realy a lot of genres, redundant, sometimes silly. There is even not a single page that do not need to be modified. '( Who could correct all this ?Danrok@  who mainly contributes at Wikipedia in German might have modified this for this reason.MovieFex (example is de.wiki and es.wiki...). books adapattion ONLY is restricted for (Q1257444)film adaptation  confirms imo this statement. But in other languages, (Q1257444)film adaptation  linked to (Q8126463)Category:Films based on works  = (P910)topic's main category  looks like to encompass every kind of works, not only books.

In general, I think we have too many genres, and if anything it is unhelpful. There are no accepted standards regarding film genres, so it is somewhat vague. My view is we should go about this the same way as professionals do, and stick to the main genres, drama, thriller, action, horror, etc. and define more specific claims using well defined properties.
