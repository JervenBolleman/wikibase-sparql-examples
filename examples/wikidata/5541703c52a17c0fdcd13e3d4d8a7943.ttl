  rdfs:comment "QueriesAfter an initial overview of the data on anabindata we tested the sample queries from WIKIDATA. It was great and impressive to see how fast the examples of great graphics and maps can be created. That definitely inspired our imagination how many great queries we could do for Mauritius and the project. Our highly motivated goal was to create the following questions:  • Which university offers a specific degree in a specific major? • What degrees does a university offer? • What degree-granting universities does a city have? • What currently existing universities are located in a specific city? • What degree-granting universities does a country have in which city? • Which universities of the country are recognised as higher education institutions (accredited, attested)? • Which country offers a specific degree in a specific major in which city? • How many universities do award a specific degree or a specific major in a country?

We realized that to work with the wikidata query service was very time consuming because of many Query timeout limit reached  etc. what is the difference and when to use which. Based on this difficulties we mainly on the queries we thought might be useful and we are able to create with information we have and can add. There was the question to show the universities on the island. shortcuts wd, wdt, p, ps, bderrors and long loading times.
