Here’s the query: --]reply[11:11, 3 January 2023 (UTC)) talk (EmuThe batch mode is quite handy but has serious limitations for item creations, qualifiers and references. OpenRefine has the advantage that you can still use batches (and thus have your edits in a handy list) but isn’t without its challenges as well.
