If you work with Openrefine, that might be an alternative.

I'm already maintaining another big project on deWikisource linking to Wikidata - M2k~dewikiHi @BLKÖ is already on my todo-list, unfortunately time is running... The above presented data model looks very good to me, i only have some suggestions (from a librarian's perspective): ;-) we shouldn't use in bibliographic context (Q665807)Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich (P361)part of therefor  (but that's not obligate, because these information exists as main statements too)(P304)page(s)  and (P478)volume  with additonal qualifiers for (Q665807)Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich (P1433)published in  BLKÖ (Add a section on German WikiSource to inform the community about this ongoing discussion here: 21:59, 28 March 2020 (UTC)) talk (Mfchris84If i have some time within the next few days i could point my script to BLKÖ and make some imports as example for further discussions. --22:07, 28 March 2020 (UTC) Jura. I suppose we could get that to work. --- [6]Yes, P1433 does look better. Feel free to move ahead as you prefer. If you create them with QuickStatements, it would have the advantage that everything gets done in one edit. BTW, I just came across an experiment I did with MxM a while ago : Jura1, Mfchris84Hello @): User:M2k~dewiki/Tools#Project_BLKÖcurrently there exist about 8.200 objects for BLKÖ (approx. volume 1 to 16 out of 60), where about 300 have a cross-reference yet (Objects with crossreference Objects without crossreference All ObjectsToday I wrote a program which can cross-reference objects based on the GND.

I really would prefer to add BLKÖ in the label to have an easy difference between the biographical item and the BIBLIOgraphical item.

P460 isn't generally used as a qualifier. HarvestTemplates could be used to set follows/followed by, if there is interest. The main advantage of cross-reference items is that we wont miss pages.
