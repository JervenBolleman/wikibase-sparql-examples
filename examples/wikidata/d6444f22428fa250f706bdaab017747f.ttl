  ### Note: P734 (family name) is a dead end and can go nowhere. If family name is removed from ?x and just included in ?y, we can still get all the relatives and their family names.

  ### This problem cannot be solved by replacing \"?x\" in \"OPTIONAL {?x wdt:P18 ?image}\" with \"?y\", which will result in more errors.
  ### This image issue seems fixed by adding a new line \"OPTIONAL {?y wdt:P18 ?image2}\". But I don't know if there is any potential error, and it is at least not simpler than just including family name in ?x.
