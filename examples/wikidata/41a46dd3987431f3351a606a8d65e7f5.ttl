But even if it is not a \"signal for merging\", I still think it would be good if this property could be avoided in case the object should be considered as \"not the same\". That's why I suggested that (P460)said to be the same as  part that I now see is part of the English description.

As (P582)end time  and/or (P580)start time -statements, each with a relevant (P131)located in the administrative territorial entity  has varied over time, you can use several (P131)located in the administrative territorial entity If the  , like from \"X\" to \"former X\", to make the differenct more obvious.(P31)instance of .

Can't hurt to do it as suggested, though.  : recently it seems we might have found a workaround for this, in which case we can import.JhealdGeoshapes are desirable but I have held off adding them due to concerns about copyright - my understanding was always that we need these to be CC-0 to go on Commons, though from a chat with @ P131 and so on are all on my \"do in the fullness of time\" list, but there are some thorny problems yet to figure out - most of the UK admin areas have changed substantially over time so it's not always clear quite what parent areas we should use for P131. (eg all the modern constituencies are mapped into regions - do we want to keep this approach for historic constituencies that pre-date the official regions)  links are a bit of a problem - we don't have a clear property to describe what I want to say, which is \"these are meaningfully different things with the same name, which are often treated as all being the same thing\". We definitely want to keep them seperated, so please don't merge - at the moment there is one item for each distinct start/end, plus for substantial changes like a switch in the number of MPs.(P460)said to be the same as : Yes, there's definitely a lot of work needing doing here, and I haven't had as much time to work on it as I'd hoped.

I'm reluctant to use different P31s, though, as really this should be clear from the dates. Larske@17:06, 8 February 2020 (UTC)) talk (Andrew Gray: Running a switch to \"different from\" now (should be done and through to the query service in a couple of hours). Thanks for the advice :-) Larske@ 19:07, 7 February 2020 (UTC)) talk (Dipsacus fullonum: Jheald suggested using a federated query to the Ordnance Survey SPARQL endpoint.
