I have given an answer to the last point. The ship \"Adfines Sky\" mentioned by Hjart is a good example how the system works in case of multiple names of the same ship. The Commons categories for two ship names, which can easily be found via Wikimedia and Wikidata search fields, are here: ]reply[21:39, 25 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (BovlbCheers,   that would benefit from your input.Wikidata:Administrators'_noticeboard#IMO_numbers_as_labelsThere is a thread at  You need to be careful about making any widespread changes here without appropriate consultation. If someone is raising objections (even if those objections are phrased over-aggressively), you need to stop and think, and seek third-party input. You have been talking about \"Wikidata-Infobox\". Presumably that is some presentation of information from Wikidata on some client project. Please be aware that, while we want Wikidata to support client projects as fully as possible, we never do this my making the Wikidata representation worse. If a client infobox needs to present information in a specific way, you need to look at how that can be solved client-side, or with judicious improvements to Wikidata.Hi Wolfgang Fricke.

If I input Adfines Sky either in the search box of Wikimedia or of Wikidata, I find the category Adfines Sky (ship...) immediately. Sometimes I add 'ship' to shorten the list of findings.

Of course, a Wikimedia category appears, which is linked to the category Adfines Sky (ship, ...) as well as to the IMO number and, hence, to the corresponding Wikidata page. As mentioned before, this makes sense, as both, \"Adfines Sky\" and \"RF Marina\", are the same ship.  ]reply[18:11, 25 November 2021 (UTC)) talk (Hjart that's unfortunately no longer possible.--(Q83631353)Adfines Sky I've tried to explain it to you before, but apparently you're still not getting it.

I only intended to change the Wikidata-Infobox (keeping the data) under the corresponding IMO number and afterwards referencing the Infobos under Danmark (ship, 1934) to this. This is the correct way how Wikidata data are handled for ships, because then the Infobox is only created and changed once even in case the ship has different names.
