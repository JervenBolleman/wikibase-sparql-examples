We sometimes use numbers at the end for subspecies and splits. So if ridgwayi is the osprey2 subspecies, carolinensis is the code for the osprey1; ospreyIn the case of e.g. Osprey, the species level code is actually , as the two projects focus on breeding species within these geographic areas. eurkesBirds of North America or Neotropical Birds do not cover vagrants like Birds of North America, Neotropical Birds, eBird, Macaulay Library and All About Birds all utilize the eBird species codes.

As we manage over 10,000 species, there are inevitable conflicts in generating codes strictly following what ABA uses, we resolve those conflicts various ways but the result is the codes don't always align.
