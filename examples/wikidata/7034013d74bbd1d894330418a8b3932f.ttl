  rdfs:comment "DiscussionOnce you populate it this way, you can find all your assignments with this query: We can change the description of P8258 and add alias \"field of study\" to match your need perfectly. (Q113604959)05 Natural sciences, mathematics and statistics  → (P8258)field of training  → (Q113556827)Mathematics Curriculum for Basic 7 The last one matches best, so I think you can say:  field of this occupation (P425), field of work (P101), field of usage (P9488), field of training (P8258)There are several props that nearly match what you need, but are over-specified to apply only to some situations:  ]reply[16:52, 28 June 2023 (UTC)) talk (DnshitobuThank you so much for your comment. Your comments are very valuable especially with the suggestions given. The third comment is not clear us and we would be glad if you explain further or give us other examples. Also, the part \"You could use some general \"classification\" property\" projects that you have a property in mind that could help us achieve the same results and we would be glad if you could mention it. If you need any further explanation, we will be glad to meet you at an agreed time. Thanks again for taking time to review our request.

You could use some general \"classification\" property, and you can figure out it's the ISCED classification since each entry is instance of  ]reply[07:18, 5 July 2023 (UTC)) talk (JneubertRight, as said in the definition of the property it is intended for external identifiers. I would not recommend to use it between Wikidata items without a discussion and consensus about a change of the scope and use of the property (preferably on the property talk page or the project chat). --: can you comment? ArthurPSmith, Jneubert and the examples show the need (narrow vs exact). However, this qualifier is intended to be used with external identifier props (check the examples on its page), not props that link to WD entries. @(P4390)mapping relation type You show qualifier  You show quailifier \"code\". Please confirm that don't plan to record such a qualifier. If you like, you can record this code in each individual ISCED entry, but not in incoming linksSuch prop is obviously needed but I have some concerns"@en;
