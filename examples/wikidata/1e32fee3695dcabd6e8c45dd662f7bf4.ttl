  rdfs:comment "Distinction between manuscripts and worksHello, . (Q21100168)Goleniscev Papyrus  which is transmitted on (Q21100150)Alexandrian World Chronicle  and (Q21100575)Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, P 13296  which is transmitted on (Q21100459)Berlin Chronicle . Obviously it would be a good idea to create distinct items for (a) the work (as an abstract concept) and (b) the textual witness it is transmitted in. While this distinction may seem artificial to some, it is in my opinion the best way going forward. Examples how to do this are (Q657420)Cologne Mani-Codex . A prominent example is (Q47461344)written work  and (Q87167)manuscript while trying to improve our data on ancient written works, I sometimes come across items that conflate The reason I'm writing this here is that I am unsure what to do with existing sitelinks. Wikipedia articles notoriously conflate textual witnesses and the works they transmit. I can think of two solutions:  (which is often used as illustration).textual witnessKeep sitelinks on the old item and make it a dedicated item for the   (as this is what most readers will be interested in)workKeep sitelinks on the old item and make it a dedicated item for the  14:14, 15 September 2023 (UTC)) talk (Jonathan GroßThoughts? 08:03, 16 September 2023 (UTC) dosisEpìGiven that it is a complex problem, I would have a slight preference for 2: when a sitelink conflates many concepts which have distinct items in Wikidata, I usually try to move the sitelink to the item which corresponds more precisely to the title and the incipit of the sitelink. Since articles regarding manuscripts and the work(s) inside them usually are titled with the name of the manuscript and have an incipit like \"X is a manuscript etc.\", I think 2 is slightly better and probably also the most intuitive one for users to be applied. Anyway, disentangling these will require a lot of effort :( -- 08:08, 16 September 2023 (UTC)) talk (Jonathan Groß would be a good starting point.
