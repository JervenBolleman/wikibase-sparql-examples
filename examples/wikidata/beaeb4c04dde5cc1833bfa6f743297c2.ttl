I'm not sure to what extent it is necessary in Jura1's example and use case to actually be able to express such subtleties. I can however understand that some confusion may arise if one has the distinction between frbr:Expression and frbr:Manifestation in mind. --(P144)based on The way the FRBR Group 1 classes have been implemented on Wikidata does not allow to express that two editions (frbr:Manifestation) are the embodiments of the same frbr:Expression.  00:20, 26 November 2017 (UTC) Jura--- \" what leads you to this conclusion?

Like the misuse of \"book\" which can relate the creative work, or a specific edition of the work.
