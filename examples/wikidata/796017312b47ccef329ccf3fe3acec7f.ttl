  rdfs:comment "Elo ratings updateI am ready to do it regularly: Replacing the links to the member's page on the FIDE's site with a more reliable link to the monthly rating file on the FIDE's site. Member's page is deleted after death, but monthly files remain. Add a chess player, if he is in the FIDE's sheet, regardless of his achievements. Or need clear criteria for adding. Although I do not see the need for this. The criteria are necessary for wikipedia in my opinion. But wikidata is for everyone, we don't know who might need this data. Delete duplicate a chess player's rating if he has not played this month and his rating has not changed. Example: one participant flooded Wikidata with useless data, for example, Garry Kasparov has 201 rating entries, but the last 140 entries are the same. Why duplicate a rating if it hasn't changed since last month? Add the maximum rating value, if such a property exists. I do not know. This property is needed in the chess player's card on Wikipedia. If there is no such property, maybe create it? Sort rating entries by date Update the chess players' ratings on a monthly basis according to the FIDE monthly reports 17:41, 28 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Игорь ТемировPlease express your opinion. 21:21, 28 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (GymnicusI am now not active in the chess field, so this should only be a hint that those actually involved can exchange ideas. Regarding the duplicated posts, you could, if you want, use the two properties start time and end time. I have already done this with chart placements, which, like the chess player ranking, change from time to time. -- 19:49, 28 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Vojtěch DostálRe: size limit - that's unfortunate. I wish there was a way to store these numerical, periodically changing data that doesn't involve Wikidata :(  19:41, 28 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Игорь ТемировApparently, Wikidata is the best option for this, but with the condition of deleting duplicate useless entries during the period when the chess player has no games.  But there is a limit to the page size, accommodates about 30 thousand chess players out of 300 thousand. This is good for the current chess rating, but bad for the history of the rating change.  for set the rating Elo to the chess player's card.module:RatingFIDE on the commons.wikimedia.org for a year now. Used in the the ratings of the best chess players. I have been posting Vojtěch Dostál@ 18:54, 28 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Vojtěch Dostál now? Tabular data on Commons Where do you envision these monthly Elo rating to go in a ten or twenty years' time? The items of chess players will have hundreds of statements for Elo ratings. Wouldn't it be better to just move all Elo ratings to Игорь Темиров@Do we still do ELO ratings for zombies? At some point people kept getting ELO ratings even for dates after their known date of death.Removing duplicate rating makes it hard or impossible to query lists for specific months. Can you show me how you would get the Elo Top 100 for, e.g. January 2009, if not every player has a rating statement for that month? Currently the query looks like this: 15:56, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Игорь Темиров\"Duplicate ratings is a misconception by the thread opener\" - FIDE provides the full rating because it is its responsibility. But we don't need unchanging ratings.  10:14, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Vojtěch Dostál can be used to aggregate this information, without any information loss. (P582)end time  and (P580)start time I agree with Jura here. If rating value does not change over a time period, it is unnecessary to state it several times. Instead, a longer time window of  06:17, 29 September 2021 (UTC) JuraI don't think Wikidata's task is to provide nonsensical ratings. If people are interested in zombies, these should go directly to FIDE. ---  06:00, 29 September 2021 (UTC)) talk (Steak\"Duplicate ratings\" is a misconception by the thread opener. A rating is not simply duplicate, when it does not change from one rating period to the next. FIDE provides Elo ratings in regular intervals (currently once per month, in former times it was e.g. twice a year), and our task is to provide this data. There is no gain in simply omitting ratings that do not change. A complete list of best ratings of current month would not be possible if players without rating change are simply left out. And yes, we also provide Elo ratings of people that are dead, when FIDE also provides this data, but these ratings are marked as deprecated.  05:56, 29 September 2021 (UTC) Jura. --- Wikidata_talk:WikiProject_Chess#Elo_ratings_updateThere is some discussion also at  : put some order in it and updates them on a quarterly basis.
