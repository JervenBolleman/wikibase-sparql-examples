# SPARQL examples extracted from Wikibase/Wikidata

These are SPARQL queries extracted from Wikibase instances such as Wikidata.

Many queries have been fixed automatically to become SPARQL 1.1 compliant. 
However, many still need to be fixed.

Code used to do the crawling and fixing is in [sparql-examples-utils](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples-utils/).

The approach to storing and visualizing queries in this way is described in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06010).

Contributions are very welcome!

# Queries are identified by their MD5 hash

At this moment you can see them [in turtle](https://github.com/JervenBolleman/wikibase-sparql-examples/tree/main/examples/wikidata).
